# Slith Engine
## Summary
This was originally developed for a class final project and later its functionalities are expanded on. It is capable of PBR rendering in real-time. The graphics library used is __OpenGL__ and modols are loaded using __Assimp__. UI is implemneted using __DearIMGUI__. It is currently in a rather messy state, because this project was originally quickly implemented as a way for me to learn real-time rendering techniques.
